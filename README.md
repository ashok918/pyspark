i am going explain about what is Pyspark and Rdd ,Dataframe and DataSets .

RDD Introduction

RDDs are collections of objects similar to a list in Python
the difference is that RDD is computed on several processes scattered across multiple physical servers,
also called nodes in a cluster, while a Python collection lives and processes in just one process.
Rdd is resielient distrubuted dataset which contain extra feature like immutable,falut tolarance....

Rdd Benefits
-----------

In-Memory processing:- PySPark load the data from disk and process it in memory, and keeps the data 
in memory.
